# Numerical Stability

```@example numerical_stability
using Distributions
using HMMBase
using PyPlot
using Seaborn

rc("axes", xmargin = 0) # hide
set_style("whitegrid")  # hide
```

Let's consider the case of a Normal distribution with null variance,
such a case can appear during maximum likelihood estimation if only
one observation is associated to a state:

```@example numerical_stability
A = [0.99 0.01; 0.1 0.9]
B = [Normal(0, 1), Normal(10.5, 0)]
hmm = HMM(A, B)
```

```@example numerical_stability
y = rand(hmm, 500)
figure(figsize = (9, 2)) # hide
plot(y)
gcf() # hide
```

The likelihood of a Normal distribution with null variance goes to infinity for `y = Î¼`,
as there is a division by zero in the density function:

```@example numerical_stability
println(extrema(loglikelihoods(hmm, y)))
```

To avoid propagating these non-finite quantities (for example in the forward-backward algorithm),
you can use the `robust` option:

```@example numerical_stability
println(extrema(loglikelihoods(hmm, y, robust = true)))
```

This truncates `+Inf` to the largest Float64, and `-Inf` to the smallest Float64:

```@example numerical_stability
log(prevfloat(Inf)), nextfloat(-Inf)
```
